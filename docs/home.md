## What can I do with My Reminders?

When you are logged in you can set a reminder for yourself well into the future.

## What is My Reminders?

My Reminders: never forget your JIRA issues again!

 - Configure multiple reminders on your issues for days, weeks, months or even years into the future (up to 10 reminders per user per issue)
 - Get your reminders delivered through Jira notifications (which will send emails to your registered address)

## Security and Compliance

My Reminders is built with security as a top priority:

- **Data never leaves Atlassian's platform** - All reminder data stays within Atlassian's secure infrastructure
- **Runs on Atlassian badge** - Meets Atlassian's strict security and compliance requirements
- **No external services** - Everything operates within your Jira Cloud environment
- **Minimal data storage** - Only stores essential information needed for reminder functionality

## Platform Requirements

- **Jira Cloud only** - Built using Atlassian Forge platform
- Requires standard Jira user permissions
- No additional software installation needed
- Works with all Jira Cloud plans

## Use Cases and Benefits

My Reminders solves critical workflow challenges across various scenarios:

### Project Management
- **Sprint planning reminders**: "Review sprint backlog before planning meeting"
- **Release milestone tracking**: "Check feature completion status 2 days before release"
- **Performance review cycles**: "Prepare team evaluations before quarterly reviews"

### Compliance and Maintenance
- **License renewal alerts**: "Renew software license 30 days before expiration"
- **Security audit reminders**: "Schedule security review for this component"
- **Documentation updates**: "Update API documentation after feature release"

### Issue Management
- **Follow-up on blocked issues**: "Check if dependency is resolved"
- **Customer escalation tracking**: "Follow up on priority customer issue"
- **Long-term issue monitoring**: "Review if this technical debt item is still relevant"

Imagine the following scenario:

> Alana has an important issue in JIRA that needs to be resolved before they ship their product to
> customers. It is critical that she does not forget about this issue before release. Watching the
> issue will not help: if nobody updates the issue then she will never be notified. The same goes
> for notification schemes. She could modify the Workflow so that all issues must go through her for
> final approval, but that seems quite heavy handed and not agile at all. Eventually she realises
> that there is no way to set reminders about issues in JIRA. "This is really annoying",
> she thinks, "there must be a better way?"

And there is. Introducing My Reminders, a Jira Cloud app designed to remind you of issues when you
ask to be reminded about them. Using this app you'll never forget an issue again. No issue can
slip your attention.

Install the app now from the Atlassian Marketplace, or (if you don't have the permission to do so) ask
the admin of your Jira Cloud instance to install it for you!
