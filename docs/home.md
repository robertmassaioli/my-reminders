When you are logged in you can set a reminder for yourself well into the future.

## What is My Reminders?

My Reminders: never forget your JIRA issues again!

 - Configure multiple reminders on your issues for days, weeks, months or even years into the future.
 - Get your reminders sent straight through to your email!

Imagine the following scenario:

> Alana has an important issue in JIRA that needs to be resolved before they ship their product to
> customers. It is critical that she does not forget about this issue before release. Watching the
> issue will not help: if nobody updates the issue then she will never be notified. The same goes
> for notification schemes. She could modify the Workflow so that all issues must go through her for
> final approval, but that seems quite heavy handed and not agile at all. Eventually she realises
> that there is no way to set reminders about issues in JIRA. "This is really annoying",
> she thinks, "there must be a better way?"

And there is. Introducing My Reminders, a plugin designed to remind you of issues when you
ask to be reminded about them. Using this plugin you'll never forget an issue again. No issue can
slip your attention.

Install the addon now into your Cloud instance, or (if you don't have the permission to do so) ask
the admin of your Cloud instance to do it for you!
